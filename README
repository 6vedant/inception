Programmatic representation of the Brilliant movie: INCEPTION by the Genius Director THY name is Christopher Nolan!
My tribute to Nolan in "C" Language and a bit of assembly (x86) as the inception is done using x86 code morphing so that Fischer wakes up thinking that the thought was originated from his mind.
